# Home storage

This is a project that created to solve famillies losing media so decided to make that project to help them store and access their media and files whenever they need.

## Description

This project will contain 3 parts

- `API:` that will be in Go(golang) since I want to have more power and accessibility to read and write files to my local machine.

- `Mobile app:` of course there's a mobile app, it will be in flutter to make it a crossplatform app.

- `Dashboard:` it will be used to manage the api and read the logs very easily for a future maintenance, it's not yet decided that it will be a desktop app of a web app right now, so I will stick with the terminal right now.
