# Home Storage API

This is a Go(golang) app that will handle the server side of the project 

## Usage 

- Make sure that Go is installed in your machine, if not install it in your machine see the link: [Golang install link](https://go.dev/doc/install)

- install all necessary packages that the project need in order for everything to work for you in the command line

## Folder structure

`Layred Structure` is used in this project.

In a layered structure, the application is organized into different layers, such as controllers (or handlers), services, repositories, and models. Each layer has its specific role, making the code easier to manage.

I used it because I consider this project to be a medium-sized project
